/*
     * This file will implement a verify email check lest we can use sign in with google in a java app
        * When the student is creating their account, an email with an auth code will be sent to the email they provided
        * The student will then be prompted to enter the auth code to verify their email
        * If the auth code is incorrect, the student will be prompted to enter the correct code or send a new email (after a wait period)
     * 
     * Auth code ideas:
     *    - Random 8 digit number
     *    - Random 16 character string
     *    - Some sort of hash or randomly generated encryption key
     *    - Random 16 character mash of numbers and letters
     *
