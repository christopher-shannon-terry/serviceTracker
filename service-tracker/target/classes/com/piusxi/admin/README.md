# Front End - Admin Module

This directory contains exclusively GUI elements and front-end related code for the administrative interface. No logic or backend code should be placed here.

## Purpose
- Houses all user interface components for administrators
- Contains visual elements and layouts
- Manages UI event handlers and listeners
- References backend functionality through proper interfaces/methods

## Components
- Admin dashboard interface
- Service hour approval forms
- Report generation interface
- User management screens
- Configuration panels

## Implementation Guidelines
- Keep all business logic in the corresponding backend classes
- Use MVC pattern - this directory contains only View components
- UI components should call methods from the admin back end directory for processing
- Maintain consistent styling across all admin interfaces
- Include form validation on the client side, but ensure server-side validation is also implemented

## Testing
- Create mockups of admin interfaces before implementation
- Test UI components with sample data
- Verify all UI interactions properly connect to backend methods
