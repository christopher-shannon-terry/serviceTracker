# Service Tracker Backend

This directory contains the backend implementation for the Service Tracker application.

## Overview

The backend provides the "server-side" logic necessary for the Service Tracker application to function.

## Guidelines
- NO GUI elements here, unless you're referencing a button or something
    - ie. in JavaScript theres this thing called document.getElementById()
        - things like this should be the only thing remotely close to GUI in the backend files

THANKS :)
