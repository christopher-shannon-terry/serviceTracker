## TO DO

- Confirmation email for supervisor and run tests on that
- Integrating with the service requirements database
    - Halfway Done
    - Know the email will be sent
    - Have to implement yes or no logic

- Scratch above
    - Already a lot of work to have IT set up a server for the database
    - Im not rewriting everything to like web scrape skyward
    - Confirmation email will just not be done
    - Will talk to Tom about it
    - In theory, can still leave the field and have tom personally email them
    - Thats just very tedious tho

- Move on to admin side
